# Can I move my Sia host to a new computer?

Yes, it is possible to [migrate your Sia host to a new computer](../../../hosting/host-setup/advanced/migrating-a-host.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Moving your host isn't recommended. It's a tough process and doesn't have a 100% success rate. Doing so might break your host completely._
{% endhint %}
