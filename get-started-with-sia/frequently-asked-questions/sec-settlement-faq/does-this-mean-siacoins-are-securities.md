# Does this mean Siacoin are securities?

No, Siacoin is not required to register as a security.

The SEC thoroughly examined Siacoin during the course of their investigation. The SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the Siacoin token or any current activity on the Sia network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the Siacoin token as a security with the SEC.
