# How does Sia's two-token model work?

Sia uses two tokens, **Siacoin** and **Siafunds**.

Siacoin is used for utility; renters buy storage space on the Sia network with Siacoin and hosts are paid in Siacoin for selling their storage space. Hosts also post collateral in Siacoin, and miners mine Siacoin via Proof-of-Work.

Siafunds are used for **revenue sharing**; a 3.9% fee from every storage-related transaction on the Sia network is distributed to the holders of Siafunds tokens.

We believe Sia’s two-token model creates an ideal ecosystem, where the Sia core team and Siafund investors are incentivized to focus on product development and long-term, sustainable network growth.
