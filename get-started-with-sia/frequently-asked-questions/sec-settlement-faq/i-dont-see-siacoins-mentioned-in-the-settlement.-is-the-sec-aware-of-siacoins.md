# Is the SEC aware of Siacoin?

The SEC thoroughly examined Siacoin during the course of their investigation. The Sia core team briefed the SEC on how Siacoin has been used since the launch of Sia in 2015 â€“ strictly for utility on the network, and never used for fundraising.

During our conversations, the SEC displayed exceptional technical knowledge on all aspects of the network, including Siacoin.
