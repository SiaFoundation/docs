# I hold or use Siacoins to rent cloud storage. What does this settlement mean for me?

Nothing!

The SEC did not take any enforcement action regarding Siacoin in their ruling, despite being well informed of how Siacoin is created and used. If you rent, you can still use Siacoin for its intended purpose â€“ renting cloud storage space on the Sia network. If you hold Siacoin, you can still keep them in your wallet or trade them on any supported exchange.
