Siacoin is used for utility on the Sia network; renters buy storage space with Siacoin and hosts are paid in Siacoin for selling their storage space. Hosts also post collateral in Siacoin and miners mine Siacoin via Proof-of-Work.

Essentially, Siacoin is the token that power the Sia network â€“ it is the network currency.

Siacoin was never used for fundraising, and the Sia core team holds less than 0.1% of the total Siacoin supply.

Siacoin is mined via Proof-of-Work, and the Sia core team pre-mined less than 0.1% of the total Siacoin supply at launch.
