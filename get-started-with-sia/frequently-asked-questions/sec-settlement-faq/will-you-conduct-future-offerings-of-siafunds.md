# Will you conduct future offerings of Siafunds?

We do not plan to conduct future offerings of Siafunds as Skynet Labs now holds the majority.

The settlement does not prevent Skynet Labs doing so however. As in the 2018 offering, future offerings would treat Siafunds as securities â€“ unless regulatory guidance changes in the future.
