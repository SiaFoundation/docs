# Announcing your Host

Now that your host has been configured and finished syncing, you can announce your host to the network.&#x20;

Announcing your host serves as the bridge between your fully prepared host and potential renters seeking storage solutions. This process publishes information about your host, including its network address and public key, onto the blockchain, allowing renters to discover your host and establish contracts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
An announcement transaction incurs a small fee in Siacoins (SC), which will be deducted from your wallet. Ensure your `hostd` wallet is funded by checking out [Transferring Siacoins](transferring-siacoins.md).
{% endhint %}

Go to `hostd`. If you're asked to unlock the UI, use your custom password if you've set one. If you haven't got a wallet set up `hostd`, visit our [Setting up `hostd`](setting-up-hostd/) guide; otherwise, choose from the sidebar **Configuration**.

Click on the **Announce** button in the top right-hand corner.

Finally, check the announcement fee and click **Announce** in the dialog to confirm.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulation! Your host has been successfully announced to the network and is now ready to be discovered by renters and establish contracts.
{% endhint %}

## Check your host's status

Once the announcement is confirmed, you can check if your host is visible on the network by going [here](https://troubleshoot.siacentral.com).&#x20;

Enter your host's network address and click **Check Host**. This tool will connect to your host and notify you of any issues.
