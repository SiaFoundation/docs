# Configuring your Host

Setting up your host on Sia also involves configuring essential parameters such as storage, bandwidth, and other critical variables. These configurations are vital to maintaining your host's health, ensuring it can effectively provide storage services to renters, and determining how much you earn from hosting.

Go to `hostd`. If you're asked to unlock the UI, use your custom password if you've set one. If you haven't got a wallet set up `hostd`, visit our [Setting up `hostd`](../setting-up-hostd/) guide; otherwise, choose from the sidebar **Configuration**.

## Host

### Port Forwarding

`hostd` needs a stable internet connection and open network access in order to store and retrieve data on the Sia network. You will also need to forward the following ports so `hostd` can properly communicate with the network and renters.

 * 9981/TCP (Sia Consensus)
 * 9984/TCP (RHP4 - SiaMux)
 * 9984/UDP (RHP4 - QUIC)

### Accepting contracts

The **Accepting Contracts** setting determines whether your host will accept new contracts. Most hosts will always have this toggled on. However, if you want to exit the network, you can toggle this off to stop accepting new contracts. You must still fulfill any existing contracts before entirely shutting down your host.

### Address

Setting the host's network **Address** is essential because it's published to the blockchain and used by renters to connect to your host. Some users use their public IP address, but we recommend setting up a domain.

{% hint style="info" %}
You have several options for setting up Dynamic DNS. We recommend utilizing straightforward, no-cost services like [DuckDNS](dynamic-dns/duckdns.md) or [Cloudflare](dynamic-dns/cloudflare-advanced.md). Additionally, you can choose to purchase a custom domain from a registrar.

Alternatively, you can set up a public IP address by clicking [here](https://icanhazip.com), which will display the public IP address that you can then copy to your clipboard.
{% endhint %}

Enter your address followed by your host's RHP2 port (which defaults to `:9982`).

For example:

* If your IP address is `199.111.78.80` you would enter `199.111.78.80:9982`.
* If your domain is `example.com`, you would enter `example.com:9982`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the **DNS** section of the host configuration, remember also to enable your chosen Dynamic DNS Provider if you opted for this option.
{% endhint %}

## Pricing

The prices you select will determine how much you earn from hosting.

When setting your prices, you are in direct competition with other hosts. Should your prices be excessively high, renters may opt for alternative hosts. Conversely, if your prices are exceedingly low, you may not generate sufficient earnings to offset your operational expenses.

Hosts are encouraged to explore various pricing options and adjust as needed to achieve the optimal balance between earnings and utilization. Nevertheless, we have provided the pricing recommendations table below for guidance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please be aware that these recommendations are only suggestions, and you can modify your pricing anytime.

## Waiting for sync

Now that you have configured your host, you must wait for your host to finish syncing the blockchain. You can check the sync progress by mousing over the Sia logo at the top of the sidebar.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/hostd_sync.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Checking the status of hostd syncing to the blockchain</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Blockchain syncing can take several hours or even days, depending on your hardware and internet connection. Make sure to have a stable internet connection to ensure your changes are made to your host.
