# macOS

This guide will walk you through setting up `hostd` on macOS. At the end of this guide, you should have the following:

* Installed Sia `hostd` software
* Created a `hostd` wallet

---

## Pre-requisites

To ensure you will not run into any issues with running `hostd` it is recommended your system meets the following requirements:

* **Network Access:** `hostd` needs a stable internet connection and open network access in order to store and retrieve data on the Sia network. You will also need to forward the ports `9981-9983` so `hostd` can properly communicate with the network and renters.

* **Operating System Compatibility:** `hostd` is supported on the following macOS versions:
	- macOS 12: Monterey (Star)
	- macOS 13: Ventura (Rome)
	- macOS 14: Sonoma (Sunburst)

* **System Updates:** Ensure that your macOS version is up to date with the latest system updates. These updates can contain important security fixes and improvements.

* **Hardware Requirements:** A stable setup that meets the following specifications is recommended. Not meeting these requirements may result in preventing slabs from uploading and can lead to a loss of data.
  - A quad-core CPU
  - 8GB of RAM
  - An SSD with at least 128GB of free space.
 
* **Software Requirements:** Before installing `hostd`, you will need to install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager. This will allow you to install and upgrade `hostd` easily.

## Installing `hostd`

Press `CMD + Space` to open Spotlight search and open a `terminal`.

Before you install `hostd`, make sure you have the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager installed.
{% endhint %}

Once the Terminal loads, use `brew` to install `hostd`:

```console
brew install siafoundation/sia/hostd
```

```console
hostd version
```

## Configuring `hostd`

Now that you have `hostd` installed, you will need to create a seed phrase and admin password. To launch the built-in configuration wizard, run the following:

```console
mkdir "~/Library/Application Support/hostd"
cd "~/Library/Application Support/hostd"
hostd config
```

When the configuration wizard loads, you will be asked to verify the location of your data directory. If you would like to change this, you can do so now. Otherwise, type `no` to keep the default.

Next, you will be asked to enter a seed phrase. If you already have one that you would like to use, you can enter it now. Otherwise, you can type `seed` to generate a new one. For the purpose of this guide, we will generate a new seed.

Next, you will be prompted to enter an admin password. This is used to unlock the `hostd` web UI.

Finally, you will be asked if you want to configure advanced settings for `hostd`. Type `no` and hit enter to exit the configuration wizard.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations, you have successfully set up `hostd`.
{% endhint %}

## Upgrading `hostd`

It is essential to keep your host up to date. New versions of `hostd` are released regularly and contain bug fixes and performance improvements.

To upgrade your `hostd` to the newest version, make sure you have shut down `hostd` and then run the following:

```console
brew upgrade siafoundation/sia/hostd
```

```
