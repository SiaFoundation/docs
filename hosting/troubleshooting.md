# Troubleshooting

Once you are set up, you can be proactive about making sure everything is set up correctly. Use the [SiaCentral Host Troubleshooter](https://troubleshoot.siacentral.com) to check your host configuration and make sure it can form contracts. Change your host address if necessary to your host's actual public IP or DDNS address.

If SiaCentral discovers issues when connecting to your host, wait an hour or two and try again - the announcement can take a little while to reach the Sia network.
