## About Skynet

Developed by [Skynet Labs](https://skynetlabs), Skynet is an open protocol and toolkit for creating a better web — one built on decentralized storage and applications.

Skynet apps transform what’s possible on the web. Beyond protecting privacy, decentralization enables application, integration, and innovation that simply cannot be replicated by the centralized world. Now, we can break free of the walled gardens and data silos that have constricted invention and interoperability. Key features of decentralization such as user-owned personal data, persistent identity across apps, and censorship-resistance will be the new standards of the digital world.

## Explore Skynet

Skynet itself is home to a quickly growing ecosystem of decentralized web apps. Complete with a global login system, user owned frontends, and cross app compatibility. Skynet has been designed as a replacement protocol to the world wide web. Enabling fully functional Web 3 applications to be built without the friction of needing to use or understand cryptocurrencies.
