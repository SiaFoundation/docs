## About Skynet

Skynet is an open protocol and toolkit for creating a better web — one built on decentralized storage and applications.

Skynet apps transform what’s possible on the web. Beyond protecting privacy, decentralization enables application, integration, and innovation that simply cannot be replicated by the centralized world. Now, we can break free of the walled gardens and data silos that have constricted invention and interoperability. Key features of decentralization such as user-owned personal data, persistent identity across apps, and censorship-resistance will be the new standards of the digital world.
