## About Rift

Rift is an app that aims to provide a decentralized alternative to the core Internet apps we all use and depend on every day.

Rift includes **document editing, file sharing, social feeds, search, video streaming**, as well as advanced tools for managing personal data, DNS, and more.

Rift is a work-in-progress but aims to provide the productivity, social, and developer features from Internet giants like Google, Facebook, or Amazon ...but reimagined as software you control.

> Rift gives you control over _your_ data, algorithms, privacy!
