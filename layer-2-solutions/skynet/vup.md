## About Vup

Vup is a fully decentralized, open-source, cloud storage application. Leveraging Skynet's built in global login system, MySky, Vup creates an encrypted and private cloud storage drive that is entirely under the users control. With Vup there is no centralized point of access which would allow for someone to deny you access to your data. Complete with a suite of tools ranging from basic file management, to fully featured content streaming via a built in JellyFin server. Vup is the dawn of a new age in user controlled cloud storage.
