# Get Involved

## Contribute to Sia

If you've got some dev skills and free time, Sia is here for you!

Sia is 100% open source. The US and EU-based Sia Foundation team have been the core developers of Sia, but hundreds of individuals have contributed either to the core code or apps built on top of the network.

While a distinct development and operations team exists, dozens of individuals have contributed to the core code or apps built on top of the network. Check out our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/SiaFoundation) if you're interested in following along or writing code for Sia and further decentralizing the project!

## Join us!

We have a wonderful community, and we hope you'll find your place there! Check the `#contributors` channel in [Discord](https://discord.com) to say "Hi," ask questions, or get opinions on your Sia-related code or app.

Join our socials to become a part of our thriving community, where you can actively engage with our ecosystem and fellow members while staying updated with the latest content, news, and developments!
