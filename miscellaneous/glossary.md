## E

**Encryption**: Encoding data to limit access to authorized parties is a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency security.

**Escrow**: A service that holds cryptocurrency or other assets in trust until specific conditions in a transaction are met.

**Exabyte**: A unit of digital information storage capacity, equivalent to one quintillion bytes (1,024 petabytes or 1 billion gigabytes(GB))

**Exchange Rate**: The value at which one cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another or traditional fiat currency.

## F

**Fiat Currency**: A government-issued, centralized currency that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold, and it derives its value from the trust and authority of the issuing government.

**File Recovery**: The process of retrieving data from the Sia network, typically through a file contract and associated redundancy.

**File Recovery Window**: When renters can recover their data if a host goes offline.

**Fork (Blockchain)**: A change in the protocol rules of a cryptocurrency, resulting in a divergence of the blockchain into two separate chains, such as a hard or soft fork.

**Fragmentation**: The process of dividing data or information into smaller parts or fragments for efficient storage, transmission, or processing.

## G

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: Hardware commonly used for cryptocurrency mining due to its suitability for complex mathematical calculations.

## H

**Hard Fork**: A significant and non-backward-compatible change to a blockchain protocol creates two chains with distinct rules.

**Hash Function**: A mathematical function used in Sia to convert data into a fixed-size string of characters (hash) for data integrity and security.

**Host**: A computer running Sia software that offers network storage space.

## I

**Incentive Structure**: The mechanism rewards hosts for providing storage space and renters for using the network while penalizing non-compliance with agreed-upon terms.

**Immutable**: The property that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity and trust.

**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: A decentralized file system that stores and shares hypermedia and other data across a peer-to-peer network.

**IP Address**: A unique numerical label assigned to devices in a computer network, used to identify and locate devices on the internet.
