# Brand Guidelines

Third-party projects constitute an integral part of the Sia ecosystem. They broaden the range of applications on Sia and enhance the network through solutions that are not actively being developed by our team.

We aim for users to discern between core and non-core projects for several reasons:

* Non-core projects often involve some level of centralization, which is entirely acceptable. Users benefit from having choices, and centralization allows for the implementation of features that are more accessible to achieve compared to those on Sia's core infrastructure.
* There's the potential for confusion where users might mistake your project for something created by the core team. We want to ensure that users know where to go for help.
* Acknowledge your dedication to your project; we desire to give it the recognition it deserves, allowing it to stand out prominently.

These Sia brand guidelines will assist those developing their project by ensuring clarity, consistency, and distinction between other projects and core Sia offerings.

## Logo and Wordmark

The Sia Foundation strictly owns the trademark in the US and advises against using the Sia logo and wordmark directly in any capacity, such as third-party projects. Users can only style the original logo and wordmark to prevent confusion and misrepresentation.

The following is an example of an acceptable change. The SiaStats logo resembles the Sia logo, but is styled significantly so as not to be confused with our trademarked version. Only projects with direct relevance (see below) may style their logo based on the Sia logo.

<div data-full-width="false">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sia_original.png" alt="" width="300"><figcaption><p>Original Sia Logo and wordmark</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/siastats.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Example of styling of the original (Siastats logo)</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The logo can be similar but **must** be differentiated from the original Sia logo and wordmark by color and design.
{% endhint %}

## Naming

Sia's trademark name is pronounced _"sigh-uh,_ not _"see-ya."_

### Direct relevance

If your project directly relates to the Sia ecosystem, or wouldn't exist outside of Sia, it's probably ok to use the term **Sia** in your project's name. Good examples of this are **SiaStats**, **Siasync**, **SiaWiki**, and **Siamining**. These projects all had straight-line relevance to the ecosystem and directly serviced the Sia network.

Check with the team if you're not sure. If you do qualify, there are two restrictions:

* Do not call your project just "**Sia"**.
* You may use the term Sia in your project, but do not append a term directly related to our business, such as **Cloud**, **Storage**, or **Backup,** or add a term that we already use like **renterd, hostd,** or **walletd.** The final name must be substantially different from current Foundation offerings.

### Projects that utilize Sia, but could also use another form of storage

If you're building a project on the Sia network, but could just as easily swap out Sia with another storage backend, don't use the term Sia in your project's name. Grant projects commonly fall into this trap.

For example, if you are building a file transfer service with Sia as your storage location, don't call it SiaSend. Now would be the time to craft a unique name that reflects your project's identity and your creative efforts. Illustrative instances of such custom names include **Pixeldrain**, **Filebase**, and **Roadie**.
