# Sia Ecosystem Fork Compliance

We are actively reaching out to exchanges and mining pools that **already support Sia** to assess their readiness for the upcoming [v2 hardfork](broken-reference). The support status of these ecosystem partners is detailed below. _Please note that this list does not include platforms that we are in contact with but do not currently support Sia._

Some quick notes about this process:

* It's unlikely _every_ exchange will upgrade immediately. Some may wait until after the fork, as they have in the past.
* Our goal is to get as many exchanges as we can to upgrade, focusing on daily volume and regional access.
  * For example, Kraken is the only US exchange that trades Siacoins, so that is very high priority for us.
* We have no ability to force an exchange to upgrade. What we _can_ do is let them know that a fork is happening and help their technical teams with the process.
* We are actively assisting every exchange that has responded to us.
* In addition to these direct efforts, we've written a [comprehensive self-service guide for exchanges](https://docs.sia.tech/navigating-the-v2-hardfork/exchanges) to support the fork and have posted about it on socials in an attempt to reach as many exchanges as possible.
* As always, we recommend never storing your tokens on an exchange. You know the old saying: not your keys, not your coins.
* If you use an exchange not on this list, we recommend reaching out to them directly to ask if they are supporting the fork.

We're using the following statuses and their definitions:

* **Notified.** We've reached out to the project to inform them of the fork.
* **Dev discussion.** Our devs are actively discussing technical aspects of the upgrade.
* **Committed.** The project has committed to upgrade.
