## Create a new wallet

When you first boot up Sia-UI, you'll be prompted to create a Siacoin wallet. A wallet lets you store Siacoins and is required to be able to upload files to the decentralized network, or rent out your storage space and earn more Siacoins.

After starting Sia, you'll see this screen. Click **Create new wallet.**
